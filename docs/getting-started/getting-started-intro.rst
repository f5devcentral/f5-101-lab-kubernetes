Introduction
============

The purpose of this lab is to give you more visibility on

* Overview of Kubernetes and its key components
* How to launch application in Kubernetes
* How to install and use F5 containerized solutions (Container connector, Application Service proxy and F5 kube proxy)

To focus on the F5 components, you have the opportunity to leverage an existing environment. To do so, we consider that you have a valid UDF access (Private Cloud of F5 Networks) to do this lab. If not, you may review the pre-requisites about our lab setup to build your own.

We also have the option to use a script to automatically deploy the F5 solutions
